# LatAm Lingo.edu
 LatAm Language and Culture School

## Strategy Plane

## External user's goal:

- To gain an understanding of and/or improve fluency in:
  1. The two dominant non-English European languages spoken in Latin America with special attention to their regional dialects.
  2. Regional indigenous languages and cultural history.
- To embrace multi-culturalism.

## Site owner:

- Boutique language school with physical classrooms in four LatAm countries. The school founders are a group of indigenous and mestizaje friends who met at university and shared the same dismay about how little their classmates (and society in general) knew about the LatAm indigenous population. Beyond the professional desire for a profitable business is their societal goal of education and awareness about their native heritage. The government and NGO heritage organisations partially fund the start-up.

## Site owner's goal:

- To inform potential users about the educational services offered and increase class enrolment.
- To educate the general public about the history of LatAm languages (pre and post-colonisation) and the indigenous populations.
